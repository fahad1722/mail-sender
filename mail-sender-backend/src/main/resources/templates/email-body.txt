Hi there,

I hope you’re doing well.

I am currently working as an Associate Software Engineer at e2open, with 1.5 years of professional experience, where I specialize in building scalable backend systems using Java, Spring Boot, Microservices, and AWS. 

Along with this, I am actively exploring and building AI-driven applications using Spring AI, with a focus on RAG, Vector Databases, ETL Pipelines, MCP Servers, and Tool Calling.

I am now actively seeking Software Engineer / Java Backend / Microservices Developer opportunities. I wanted to check if there are any openings at your organization, or if you would be kind enough to refer me to any suitable roles.

You can find my portfolio here for a quick overview of my work:

I have attached my Resume for your reference. If there is any role matching my profile, I would be extremely grateful for your consideration. 

Thank you very much for your time and support.

Warm regards,
Fahad Mohammed
